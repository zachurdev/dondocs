  supplementalInfo: `1. On 15 January 2025, you failed to achieve the minimum standards on the Physical Fitness Test (PFT) as required by reference (a). Your scores were as follows:

   b. Crunches: 85
   c. 3-Mile Run: 28:45 (maximum 28:00 required)
   d. Total Score: 195 (3rd Class, failing)

2. As a Marine infantryman, physical fitness is fundamental to your ability to perform your duties and maintain combat readiness. This failure reflects a lack of dedication to maintaining the standards expected of all Marines.

3. You were previously counseled on 01 November 2024 regarding unsatisfactory PT performance and provided remedial PT opportunities. Despite these efforts, you have failed to demonstrate improvement.

4. You are hereby directed to:
   a. Participate in the Remedial PT Program effective immediately
   b. Report to the Company Gunny daily at 0500 for additional PT
   c. Achieve a passing PFT score within 90 days

5. Failure to achieve a passing score on your next scheduled PFT may result in administrative separation processing under reference (b), or other adverse administrative action as deemed appropriate.

6. Your signature below acknowledges receipt of this counseling. You have the right to submit a written rebuttal within 10 working days.`,
